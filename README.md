# InfinityKnight
a scrolling chess puzzle game made in unity for the cougHacks Hackathon at WSU. In the game, you "pilot" a knight around an infinitely scrolling chessboard
you do so, wilst avoiding bishops and rooks, as well as red spikes following your tail, and a mysterious red fog up ahead (don't touch either or you'll die!)
the farther you make it, the more points you score. The high score is stored in the backend, and updates whenever the player beats it.
